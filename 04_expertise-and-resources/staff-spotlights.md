# Yasi Ghadar, Computational Scientist

Yasaman (Yasi) Ghadar joined the ALCF in 2016 as a postdoctoral researcher using molecular dynamic simulations to understand the mechanism of ion transfer in lithium-ion batteries. In August 2018, she joined the performance engineering team as an assistant computational scientist, continuing her work with the LAMMPS application and as a point of contact for ECP's EXAALT ECP project. She also began helping to coordinate ALCF training events, including workshops and webinars. In December 2022, Yasi was promoted to the role of computational scientist at the ALCF. She was also selected to participate in Argonne's 2022-2023 Strategic Laboratory Leadership Program, an executive leadership program designed for the laboratory’s emerging leaders.

This year, Yasi joined the ECP Training and Productivity team as a PI. To recognize her efforts in training, she was invited to chair project tutorials at next year’s ECP Annual Meeting. This year also saw Yasi serve as the deputy director of the Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing (ATPESC), where she worked closely with ATPESC director Ray Loy to organize and hold the annual program in-person at Q-Center in St. Charles, IL, after two years of being a virtual event. In celebration of ATPESC's 10th anniversary, the successful event included an evening talk from ATPESC founding director Paul Messina. Yasi played a key role in a number of other ALCF-hosted events, including leading the ALCF-NVIDIA GPU Hackathon and co-organizing the Aurora Center of Excellence Workshop. In addition, she initiated a multi-lab collaboration with OLCF and NERSC to cross-promote each other's training events and opportunities to their respective user communities.

Yasi also contributed to the Argonne-led Lab Structure and Process initiative. Serving as a committee member, their goal was to identify aspects of the national laboratory structure and process that led to vulnerabilities for harassment. The committee's findings were shared internally and externally to inform interventions and recommendations to prevent sexual and gender harassment at the lab, throughout the national laboratory community, and in the higher education community. She was awarded an Argonne Impact award for her efforts on the committee.



# Ben Lenard, HPC Systems & Database Administrator

Ben Lenard joined the ALCF in 2015 as an HPC Systems & Database Administrator, responsible for overseeing the administration and improvement of database, monitoring, Kafka, and non-HPC storage systems in the ALCF supercomputing environment. He has presented at Cray Users Group as well as various Db2 events, and was a panelist at Tapia 2022. In addition to his day-to-day responsibilities, Ben has been strong advocate for the ALCF and for computer science, volunteering for events like the Hour of Code, Northern Illinois University STEM Fest, and Argonne’s public open house. 

Some of Ben’s notable 2022 activities included deploying Jenkins with Brian Homerding for Polaris AT as well as other various Polaris deployment activities. Jenkins deployment replaced a custom written application with an open-source package that provided similar functionality. Jenkins provided enhancements to AT such as Slack Messaging when a AT job failed. Ben also deployed ALCF’s centralized Kafka cluster that is used for BI to act as a data stream conduit between source systems and their processes for data consumption. Also a large part of Ben’s 2022 included various Polaris support activities ranging from Acceptance Test, AT, testing, to helping AIG with PBS, to helping BI receive the data they need.

# Eric Pershey, Principal Software Development Specialist

Eric Pershey joined the ALCF in 2010 as a Software Developer Specialist in the Advanced Integration Group.  Since he has joined, He has tested, worked on, or ran on all the ALCF supercomputers. Eric designs and develops the integration and testing of PBSPro on ALCF's next generation computing systems.  He also develops system tools for debugging problems using visualizations and instrumentation.  Eric’s research interests are graph theory combined with bitwise operations, AI, large-scale data generation, processing, and fidelity of metadata in high-performance computing systems.  He has a master’s degree in Computer Science from DePaul University and a bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering Technology from DeVry University.

In 2022, Eric worked on integrating PBS into all of our new systems, including Polaris, EDTB, Crux, and Graphcore. He tested and pushed PBS to the limits on each system to make sure they could handle it. In 2022, he also built up ALCF infrastucure in a box called pbs-docker to emulate our real pbs environment by creating test jobs to stress the scheduler, OpenPBS and PBSPro. He also created a test suite to push the scheduler to the limit by crushing it with jobs and measuring how it handles to find weaknesses in the code. Eric has also spent a large number of his time at the ALCF working on the OAR and mentoring students. 



# Katie Sims-Partacz, Division Finance Manager

Katie Sims-Partacz oversees finance and business operations for Argonne’s Leadership Computing Facility. She leads the planning, execution, and oversight of the Leadership Computing’s annual budget ($156 MM in FY2022). Ms. Sims-Partacz has strong and diverse experience in various areas, including financial analysis, budgeting, accounting, procurements, and information technology.

Previously at Argonne, she worked for the Chief Financial Officer from 2016-2020, where she held positions of increasing responsibility in the Accounting, Procurement, and Budget Offices.  She has extensive experience in financial reporting and sponsor relationships. Prior to joining Argonne National Laboratory, Katie worked in information technology and accounting roles at VCNA Prairie Material and Tripp-Lite. Ms. Sims-Partacz has a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Finance from Saint Xavier University.

In 2021, Katie received an Impact Argonne Award for a notable achievement in extraordinary Effort. She took on management of the ECP reporting, as well as training several people – in FMPS and ALCF. Outside of ALCF, Katie is passionate about raising funds and promoting awareness for pediatric cardiovascular thoracic surgery research. In 2011, she launched a non-profit, Patching Little Hearts, and served as its president for one year. She continues as an advocate for congenital heart defect and breast cancer awareness. Katie has interests in skiing, live music, playing softball, and home improvement.

# Brice Videau, Computer Scientist

Brice Videau joined the ALCF in 2019, as a computer scientist with a joint appointment with MCS, focusing on code generation, meta-programming, optimization, and auto-tuning for High Performance Computing. As a part of the ALCF Performance Engineering team, Brice works on heterogeneous programming models, which are the programming models used to leverage accelerators and GPUs such as those we will be using in Aurora. In 2022, Brice lead the HIP on Aurora ECP project where he and his team are bringing the HIP programming model used on frontier to the Intel GPUs, so application developers can reuse their HIP code and avoid the added work of porting their application to the SYCL programming model. Since last year, his team has seen the first release of their HIP backend called CHIP-SPV, and are closely working with application developers from ECP and other projects to bring their HIP applications to Aurora using our work.

In 2022, Brice also co-lead the development of the THAPI tracing infrastructure, where he and Thomas Applencourt provided ALCF users with a lightweight tracing and profiling toolchain for heterogeneous programming models. This allowed application developers and performance engineers to quickly diagnose application performance, introspect high level programming model utilization of accelerators, but also helped immensely when debugging applications and vendor provided runtimes. This year, on top of many quality improvements, they've added support for OpenMP as well as advanced trace visualization capabilities.
