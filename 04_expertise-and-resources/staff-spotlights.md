Yasi Ghadar joined the ALCF in 2016 as a postdoc using molecular dynamic simulations to understand the mechanism of ion transfer in Li ion batteries. In August 2018, she joined the performance engineering (PE) team as an assistant computational scientist, continuing her work with LAMMPS application and as a point of contact for EXAALT ECP project and began helping coordinate ALCF training and workshops. In December 2022, she was promoted to RD3 as computational scientist at ALCF. 

In 2022, Yasi was selected to participate in Strategic Laboratory Leadership Program of 2022-2023. She also joined the ECP Training and Productivity as PI, and as a way of recognizing her efforts in training was invited to chair next yearâ€™s ECP AM project tutorials as well. This year also saw Yasi serving as an ATPESC Deputy Director, where she worked closely with Ray Loy to hold the 10th ATPESC in-person at Q-Center. The event was a success, and they celebrated the 10th anniversary with an evening talk from Paul Messina and were awarded for bringing ATPESC live again. 2022 also saw Yasi active in lots of ALCF hosted events, leading the NVIDIA GPU Hackathon and co-organizing the Aurora COE Workshop. Among that, she initiated multi lab collaboration with OLCF and NERSC to promote cross DOE labs training event and opportunities. Yasi was also was part of Lab Structure and Process initiative. The goal for this committee was to identify aspects of the national laboratory structure and process that lead to vulnerabilities for harassment. The data identified by this committee was shared internally and externally to inform interventions and recommendations to prevent sexual and gender harassment at the lab, throughout the national laboratory community, and the higher education community. She was awarded an Impact award for being part of this committee.
