# Yasi Ghadar, Computational Scientist

Yasi Ghadar joined the ALCF in 2016 as a postdoc using molecular dynamic simulations to understand the mechanism of ion transfer in Li ion batteries. In August 2018, she joined the performance engineering (PE) team as an assistant computational scientist, continuing her work with LAMMPS application and as a point of contact for EXAALT ECP project and began helping coordinate ALCF training and workshops. In December 2022, she was promoted to RD3 as computational scientist at ALCF. 

In 2022, Yasi was selected to participate in Strategic Laboratory Leadership Program of 2022-2023. She also joined the ECP Training and Productivity as PI, and as a way of recognizing her efforts in training was invited to chair next year’s ECP AM project tutorials as well. This year also saw Yasi serving as an ATPESC Deputy Director, where she worked closely with Ray Loy to hold the 10th ATPESC in-person at Q-Center. The event was a success, and they celebrated the 10th anniversary with an evening talk from Paul Messina and were awarded for bringing ATPESC live again. 2022 also saw Yasi active in lots of ALCF hosted events, leading the NVIDIA GPU Hackathon and co-organizing the Aurora COE Workshop. Among that, she initiated multi lab collaboration with OLCF and NERSC to promote cross DOE labs training event and opportunities. Yasi was also was part of Lab Structure and Process initiative. The goal for this committee was to identify aspects of the national laboratory structure and process that lead to vulnerabilities for harassment. The data identified by this committee was shared internally and externally to inform interventions and recommendations to prevent sexual and gender harassment at the lab, throughout the national laboratory community, and the higher education community. She was awarded an Impact award for being part of this committee.



# Ben Lenard, HPC Systems & Database Administrator

Ben Lenard joined the ALCF in 2015 as an HPC Systems & Database Administrator, responsible for overseeing the administration and improvement of database, monitoring, Kafka, and non-HPC storage systems in the ALCF supercomputing environment. He has presented at Cray Users Group as well as various Db2 events, and was a panelist at Tapia 2022. In addition to his day-to-day responsibilities, Ben has been strong advocate for the ALCF and for computer science, volunteering for events like the Hour of Code, Northern Illinois University STEM Fest, and Argonne’s public open house. 

Some of Ben’s notable 2022 activities included deploying Jenkins with Brian Homerding for Polaris AT as well as other various Polaris deployment activities. Jenkins deployment replaced a custom written application with an open-source package that provided similar functionality. Jenkins provided enhancements to AT such as Slack Messaging when a AT job failed. Ben also deployed ALCF’s centralized Kafka cluster that is used for BI to act as a data stream conduit between source systems and their processes for data consumption. Also a large part of Ben’s 2022 included various Polaris support activities ranging from Acceptance Test, AT, testing, to helping AIG with PBS, to helping BI receive the data they need.

# Eric Pershey, Principal Software Development Specialist

Eric Pershey joined the ALCF in 2010 as a Software Developer Specialist in the Advanced Integration Group.  Since he has joined, He has tested, worked on, or ran on all the ALCF supercomputers. Eric designs and develops the integration and testing of PBSPro on ALCF's next generation computing systems.  He also develops system tools for debugging problems using visualizations and instrumentation.  Eric’s research interests are graph theory combined with bitwise operations, AI, large-scale data generation, processing, and fidelity of metadata in high-performance computing systems.  He has a master’s degree in Computer Science from DePaul University and a bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering Technology from DeVry University.

In 2022, Eric worked on integrating PBS into all of our new systems, including Polaris, EDTB, Crux, and Graphcore. He tested and pushed PBS to the limits on each system to make sure they could handle it. In 2022, he also built up ALCF infrastucure in a box called pbs-docker to emulate our real pbs environment by creating test jobs to stress the scheduler, OpenPBS and PBSPro. He also created a test suite to push the scheduler to the limit by crushing it with jobs and measuring how it handles to find weaknesses in the code. Eric has also spent a large number of his time at the ALCF working on the OAR and mentoring students. 



# Katie Sims-Partacz, Division Finance Manager

Katie Sims-Partacz oversees finance and business operations for Argonne’s Leadership Computing Facility. She leads the planning, execution, and oversight of the Leadership Computing’s annual budget ($156 MM in FY2022). Ms. Sims-Partacz has strong and diverse experience in various areas, including financial analysis, budgeting, accounting, procurements, and information technology.

Previously at Argonne, she worked for the Chief Financial Officer from 2016-2020, where she held positions of increasing responsibility in the Accounting, Procurement, and Budget Offices.  She has extensive experience in financial reporting and sponsor relationships. Prior to joining Argonne National Laboratory, Katie worked in information technology and accounting roles at VCNA Prairie Material and Tripp-Lite. Ms. Sims-Partacz has a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Finance from Saint Xavier University.

In 2021, Katie received an Impact Argonne Award for a notable achievement in extraordinary Effort. She took on management of the ECP reporting, as well as training several people – in FMPS and ALCF. Outside of ALCF, Katie is passionate about raising funds and promoting awareness for pediatric cardiovascular thoracic surgery research. In 2011, she launched a non-profit, Patching Little Hearts, and served as its president for one year. She continues as an advocate for congenital heart defect and breast cancer awareness. Katie has interests in skiing, live music, playing softball, and home improvement.

# Brice Videau, Computer Scientist

Brice Videau joined the ALCF in 2019, as a computer scientist with a joint appointment with MCS, focusing on code generation, meta-programming, optimization, and auto-tuning for High Performance Computing. As a part of the ALCF Performance Engineering team, Brice works on heterogeneous programming models, which are the programming models used to leverage accelerators and GPUs such as those we will be using in Aurora. In 2022, Brice lead the HIP on Aurora ECP project where he and his team are bringing the HIP programming model used on frontier to the Intel GPUs, so application developers can reuse their HIP code and avoid the added work of porting their application to the SYCL programming model. Since last year, his team has seen the first release of their HIP backend called CHIP-SPV, and are closely working with application developers from ECP and other projects to bring their HIP applications to Aurora using our work.

In 2022, Brice also co-lead the development of the THAPI tracing infrastructure, where he and Thomas Applencourt provided ALCF users with a lightweight tracing and profiling toolchain for heterogeneous programming models. This allowed application developers and performance engineers to quickly diagnose application performance, introspect high level programming model utilization of accelerators, but also helped immensely when debugging applications and vendor provided runtimes. This year, on top of many quality improvements, they've added support for OpenMP as well as advanced trace visualization capabilities.
